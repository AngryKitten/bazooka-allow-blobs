# Babs

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.3.
If you do not have Angular CLI installed globally on your machine yet, do so by running `npm install -g @Angular/cli`. To verify it has been installed correctly, run `ng -v` and you should see a version splash.
When the project is initially cloned or package.json has been updated, run `npm install` to keep your node_modules up to date.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`. You can shorthand these commands by only using the first letter of each word `ng g c component-name`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running end-to-end tests
